## Required information I added to the form

**Title:** 2024-Chen-Phylogenomics

**Public overview:**  

> General overview  
> I'm working with Molly Chen generating many large phylogenomics trees as part of her PhD work with her advisor Dr. Laura Hug. Frequently it requires tuning parameters and trying to launch several tree attempts before finding successful settings. We would be greatly aided by being able to create and utilize several instances.
> 
> How we plan to use ACCESS resources  
> We will be utilizing the ACCESS resources to spin up plain Unix environments with conda installed and attached to a shared volume. Using Jetstream2 managed through Exosphere and Horizon would be ideal.
>  
> Thanks for your consideration and help!

<!-- ### Transferring credits from ACCESS to Jetstream2
Once approved, and logged in, needed this page (https://allocations.access-ci.org/requests) in order to transfer ACCESS credits to a specific resource. For the appropriate allocation/Project, selected "Credits + Resources", then the text box that initially says "Add a resource to your exchange...", then selected "Indiana Jetstream2 CPU", then entered 190,000. Then for "Indiana Jetstream2 Storage" added the remaining 10,000, giving 10 TB of shared storage to use. -->
